Problem:    Travel
Algorithms: - A*
            - Breadth-First Search
            - Depth-First Search
Input:      first line:
              <start> <end>
            following lines:
              <start> [<end> <cost>]+
            where <start> and <end> are
            names containing no whitespace,
            and <cost> is an integer.
Output:     a tuple of the route cost and the
            locations in order of visit.
Goal:       reach the end location from the
            first location. Optionally search
            for the shortest path.
