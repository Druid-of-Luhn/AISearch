Problem:    8/15 tiles
Algorithms: A*
Input:      unique numbers in [0;n[, where
            sqrt(n) is a natural number,
            separated by whitespace.
Output:     the list of tile indices that the
            0 tile should be moved into to
            reach the goal state.
Goal:       reach a state with the numbers in
            growing order from 0 to n - 1.
